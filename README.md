# Web3 & Blockchain Projects — Production Branch (`main`)

Welcome to the official repository of my Web3 and blockchain experiments, decentralized applications (DApps), and development tools.
This repository serves as the main production branch, where all finalized and thoroughly tested Web3 projects are housed.

## 🚀 Overview

This workspace is designed to support and showcase multiple decentralized applications and tools.  
Each project lives in its own subdirectory with a self-contained structure and documentation.

  A minimal decentralized counter application deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.  
  Features wallet connection, smart contract interaction, and transaction feedback.
